This is a fork of the original Always-On-Server-for-Multiplayer mod for Stardew Valley, created by the awesome funny-snek.

Why the Fork of the Fork?

It appears funny-snek may no longer be actively involved in the Stardew Valley modding community. To keep this valuable mod alive and potentially add future improvements, moy's fork was been created. I don't know what moy's story is but their version of the mod does not work on a few counts, so I seek to fix them

What's Included?

This fork provides the same functionality as the original mod, allowing you to run a dedicated headless server for Stardew Valley multiplayer, even when the host isn't actively playing.
